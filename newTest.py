    I am a highly trained therapist.  I can provide you with some insights on how to analyze the sentences spoken by a person and try to understand their emotional state and classify them into the following categories and

    1. "You are not absolutely sure you know what the participant is thinking": If the person is using vague or ambiguous language, or if their statements are open to interpretation, it may be difficult to determine their exact thoughts or emotions. In this case, you must ask clarifying questions to gain a better understanding of their perspective.
    2. "Something happens that seems to surprise the person": If the person expresses surprise or shock in their tone or language, it may indicate that they were not expecting a particular outcome or situation. You must ask them what specifically surprised them and explore how they feel about it.
    3. "The person is trying to get you to give them a clue": If the person is asking for guidance or direction, it may be because they feel uncertain or unsure about a particular situation. You must ask them more questions to understand their context and help them arrive at their own conclusion.
    4. "The person asks you to explain how something works or is supposed to work": If the person is seeking clarification or understanding, it may be because they are trying to make sense of a complex topic or process. You must provide clear and concise explanations and ask them if they have any further questions or concerns.
